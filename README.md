Expression Collector
===================

Expression Collector is a small game built using the python framework, Kivy. The player controls one expression in a field of randomly spawning expressions. If the player expression collides with an expresstion that is of equal or less value, that value is added to the player expression's value. If the player expresssion collides with an expression that is of greater value, the game is over. Additionally, if the player expression reaches of a value of 0 or less, the game is over. 

The player expression moves in the direction that the player swipes in. A short swipe will cause the player expression to move one space in that direction. A medium swipe will cause the player expression to move two spaces in that direction (jumping over one space). A long swipe will cause the player expression to slide in that direction until the player taps the screen. 

The goal for the player is to make his/her expression as big as possible.
